      Sparrow is a Bitcoin wallet for those who value financial self sovereignty. Sparrow’s emphasis is on security, privacy and usability. Sparrow does not hide information from you - on the contrary it attempts to provide as much detail as possible about your transactions and UTXOs, but in a way that is manageable and usable. Sparrow supports all the features you would expect from a modern Bitcoin wallet:  • Full support for single sig and multisig wallets on common script types  • A range of connection options: Public servers, Bitcoin Core and private Electrum servers  • Standards based including full PSBT support  • Support for all common hardware wallets in USB and airgapped modes  • Full coin and fee control with comprehensive coin selection  • Labeling of all transactions, inputs and outputs  • Lightweight and multi platform  • Send and receive to PayNyms, both directly (BIP47) and collaboratively  • Built in Tor  • Testnet, regtest and signet support
